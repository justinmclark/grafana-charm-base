    # for example, a grafana-source could be prometheus
    # there are a few required fields that incoming
    # relations must share.
    # - ingress-address
    # - port (of the grafana source)
    # - (not required) human readable name of the grafana source (e.g. Prometheus App X)
    #   if a name is not given, the default will be unit name (e.g. prometheus/0)
